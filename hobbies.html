                                    Starting with BASIC in 2012, I've almost constantly been working on programming projects.
                                    I made my first website in PHP in 2013 and my first scripting language interpreter in C++
                                    in 2016. Although I'm constantly learning new things, most of my experience is in C/C++ 
                                    and JavaScript (Mostly Node.js). I've used Java and PHP enough to know that I dislike 
                                    both of them. I've worked on too many programming projects to go into a large amount of
                                    detail on all of them, but to summarize my past 10 years of programming:

                                    In elementary school in 2009, I wanted to make RC model airplanes but couldn't afford the hobby.
                                    I would purchase cheap RC toys and attach the electronics to my own models with some success.
                                    By 2010 I cared more about electronics than planes and had several used textbooks that taught me
                                    the basics of circuitry. By salvaging all the old electronics I could gain access to I quickly
                                    amassed a large collection of components. Since 2012, when I purchased my first Arduino, I things have gotten easier,
                                    but I still know enough many applications.

                                    In 2012 while working on an earthquake machine for science fair, I continuously found myself
                                    in need of parts with 3d printing out of my reach at the time. I decided I should try metal work.
                                    I cleared an area on my parents woodlot and constructed a sheltered structure and a mine that quickly transitioned into a well.

                                    After several iterations, I successfully made a forge that used anthracite coal to melt Aluminium and other metals.
